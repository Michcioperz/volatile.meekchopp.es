      So I've just run into [yet another "smarter, faster web browser"](https://minbrowser.github.io/min/). Yes, it it Electron based. I guess it's true what they said at the foundations of programming lecture, that we care about speed more than about memory, because memory can never be worse than speed. But... omg they said "it uses less battery power". Tell me all about how a freakin' Electron uses less battery power.

      I couldn't wait for the next episode of Inuyashiki anime, so I kinda sat down and read it all until the ending, but what I saw there just put me in the same sort of limbo Lucid9 did. The ending's great, but there's no catharsis in it for me.
