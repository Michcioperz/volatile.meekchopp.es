With some of the negative press _Animal Crossing Pocket Camp_ is getting you'd think it's an outright bad game. But I guess that's more complex. For once, I am not constantly tired of it and wanting it to die, instead, I am tired of it every now and then -- for example, right now, because it's unwilling to give me any Christmas-special-event materials.

And still there's another thing about _Animal Crossing_ as a series -- I see it as a (please forgive me) training camp for capitalism. If you just think about it, you're constantly in debt, and the game repeatedly rewards you for taking actions (which is how capitalism is supposed to work I guess?).
