This year's Facebook's personal Year in Review video kicks off with a photo of my Nokia E51 and generally just goes through my various posts, interlaced with big words like "doing things together" followed by even more posts of mine that have no sign of anybody else.

Is this just how Facebook does it for people who don't upload photos of themselves and/or don't upload photos of themselves with friends?

I should really get rid of it.
