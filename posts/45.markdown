I've run into [this Verge article about Jóhann Jóhannsson's death](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/10/16999228/johann-johannsson-composer-arrival-prisoners-sicario-blade-runner-2049-obituary), and though I haven't heard any works previously, I fell in love with _IBM 1401, A User's Manual_. Good stuff.
