On the positive note, while I failed my Foundations of Maths exam, I think I did pretty well on the Linear Algebra one. I mean, I can't see the results just yet, but the parts that do have the points assigned already went well, like that madly exhausting task with Jordan matrices of endomorphisms with 4 conditions where I scored 10/10.
