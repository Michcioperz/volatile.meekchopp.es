I think I came up with a really nice RPG setting for my friends, I owe them an actually good campaign after that monstrosity a year an a half ago when they forced me to DM without former experienceâ€¦ Yeah, I mean, maybe I don't really owe them anything, but still some funny concepts.

Thinking up some scenarios for fantasy over real world canvas, including Polish politicians and some situational comedy that would appeal to my friends.
