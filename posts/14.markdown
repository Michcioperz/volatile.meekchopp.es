I saw [peppy's video about progress on osu!lazer](https://mobile.twitter.com/ppy/status/947485000714162177) last night, and the project sure has come a long way, I love the designs, I even played a little, and it looks almost finished, aside from missing the connection to Bancho and multiplayer (which I don't really miss? never played it really).

It also turned out that I got a little bit better at osu! itself, when playing with my brother's old gaming mouse he ditched for a new Logitech and with my laptop's built-in mediocre keyboard. Maybe even better than when I played with a tablet and a mecha keyboard.
