I don't quite know how to feel about Patreon's new _Lens_ feature. I hate how many apps have the timing out stories feature. At the same time, I do understand that there's no one who could possibly watch all the content people produce and archive. But that doesn't justify the format, and how the popularity of stories boils down to abusing people's fear of missing out.

All that aside, I really can't wait for Snapchat or some other stories abuser to suddenly turn out to have kept all the content, running algorithms on it and giving you back the best stories or something.
