So, I tried GeForce Now thing to play Overwatch, because I felt like having a quick match without installing. And it went mostly well. Mostly.

Suddenly during a match the connection went dialup quality and it felt like watching a YouTube video at 144p, 6 frames per second. It stayed like this for a minute. It happened again later, except this time it ended with complete disconnection. So there's that.

Also hey, did the meta-game change? I played two games and both times my team kept getting smashed into the ground without getting a chance to leave the spawnpoint.
