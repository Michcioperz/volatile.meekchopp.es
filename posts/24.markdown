People say the landscape seen from a high speed highway are boring, but it turns out the same applies to a high speed highway in building. It's just huge plots of land dug up, reshaped, accompanied by half-finished bridges and other pieces of concrete. I've had a deja vu thrice over one hour and the travel's far from over yet.
