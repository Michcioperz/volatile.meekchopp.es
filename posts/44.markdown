Forget _Darling in the Franxx_, forget _Death March_, forget _Citrus_, the real anime of the season is _Yuru Camp_.

I'd never thought I'd fall for another cutegirlsdoingcutethings anime after _New Game_ but here we are. Probably got something to do with uni and my willingness to drop out and disappear into the mountains of Bieszczady.
